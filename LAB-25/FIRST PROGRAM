1.A company is analysing the salaries of its employees. Apply your understanding of Univariate EDA to 
calculate and compare the mean, median, and mode of the salary distribution. Discuss the implications 
of any disparities between these measures. Write R code to calculate the mean, median, and mode of 
the salary distribution and interpret the results in the context of employee salaries.

CODE: 
salaries <- c(50000, 60000, 75000, 90000, 100000, 120000, 140000, 200000, 250000, 300000)
mean_salary <- mean(salaries)
median_salary <- median(salaries)
mode_salary <- function(x) {
  uniq_x <- unique(x)
  uniq_x[which.max(tabulate(match(x, uniq_x)))]
}
mode_salary_value <- mode_salary(salaries)
cat("Mean Salary: ", mean_salary, "\n")
cat("Median Salary: ", median_salary, "\n")
cat("Mode Salary: ", mode_salary_value, "\n")
if (mean_salary > median_salary) {
  cat("The salary distribution is right-skewed (positively skewed), meaning there may be a few high-paying employees.")
} else if (mean_salary < median_salary) {
  cat("The salary distribution is left-skewed (negatively skewed), indicating that most employees have lower salaries.")
} else {
  cat("The salary distribution is symmetric.")
}

#OUTPUT
Mean Salary:  138500 
Median Salary:  110000 
Mode Salary:  50000 
The salary distribution is right-skewed (positively skewed), meaning there may be a few high-paying employees.
